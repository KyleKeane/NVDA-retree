# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Pattern matching for labels (V1).** New `patterns.py` module
  (stdlib only, ~120 lines) lets stored `ObjectId`s carry
  `WILDCARD` (`None`) in per-node `discriminator` or
  `sibling_index` slots. `LabelStore.get` now falls back to a
  pattern scan when the exact id misses, picking the most
  specific pattern when several apply. The label dialog gained an
  "Apply this label to any object with the same role and position,
  ignoring name changes" checkbox. Tick it to attach the label to
  any object in the same spot regardless of what its name says —
  e.g. a button that toggles between "Save" and "Save As…".
- `SemanticTree.assign` now refuses pattern IDs with a clear
  `ValueError`. Tree-level pattern assignments are planned V2
  work; the guard prevents accidental leakage.

### Fixed
- **State files now actually persist across NVDA restarts.**
  `LabelStore.from_dict` and `SemanticTree.from_dict` only
  converted the outer JSON array back to a tuple, leaving nested
  path arrays as lists — which are unhashable and would blow up
  on the next dict lookup. `storage.load` then caught the
  resulting `TypeError` and silently quarantined the file. Net
  effect: the identity fix from PR #11 was working in memory but
  could never survive a restart. Both `from_dict`s now decode
  recursively, so nested paths come back as nested tuples and
  stay hashable.


### Added
- **Release + update documentation.** `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s
  **Releasing** section is now a full walkthrough: pre-flight
  check, version-bump PR, tag-and-push, verification, SemVer
  policy, and a "don't move a tag, cut a patch" recovery guide.
  `addon/doc/en/readme.md` gains a **Staying up to date** section
  for end users describing the Tools menu item and the "install
  never touches your state" guarantee. `README.md` references the
  update path from the installation section. `docs/smoke_test.md`
  gains a section 11 covering the update-check menu item so
  testers verify the integration without actually installing
  anything.

### Added
- **Self-update check.** A new **"Check for Semantic Tree updates…"**
  item under NVDA → Tools asks GitHub's Releases API whether a newer
  version exists, shows the release notes, and offers to install
  with a single click. Download + install go through NVDA's
  standard `.nvda-addon` file-association flow, so the usual
  confirmation dialog and restart prompt apply. User's
  `semanticTree.json` is not touched by the installer and rides
  through every update automatically; breaking schema changes are
  handled by the existing version-quarantine path in `storage.py`.
  Stdlib only (`urllib.request` + `json`) — no `requests`, no
  `packaging`. 19 new unit tests cover the pure logic via an
  injected fetcher.


### Changed — state-file schema bump (breaking)
- **Object identity is now stable across app restarts.** The old
  identity tuple included `windowHandle`, which Windows reassigns
  every time a window opens — so labels and assignments did not
  actually survive closing and reopening an app. The new identity
  is `(app_name, path)` where `path` is a tuple of
  `(role, discriminator, sibling_index)` node signatures walking
  root-to-self. Nothing OS-assigned appears anywhere. See
  `docs/developer_guide.md` "`ObjectId`" for the per-node
  discriminator policy.
- **`semanticTree.json` schema version bumped from 1 to 2.**
  Existing v1 state files are quarantined on first load
  (renamed to `<path>.corrupt-<timestamp>`, clear warning in the
  NVDA log) and the add-on starts empty. The old IDs cannot be
  remapped without a live accessibility tree, so a clean break is
  the honest choice. Re-create any labels / assignments you care
  about on first run.
- Bundled `docs/smoke_test.md` section 9 split into 9a (re-open
  app) and 9b (restart NVDA) so the app-restart case is explicitly
  exercised during smoke testing.

### Added
- `docs/smoke_test.md` — standalone, no-context-required smoke-test
  walkthrough. Hand it to anyone you ask to exercise a build
  end-to-end; it covers install, gesture registration, help file,
  label, assign, four-way navigation, search, persistence across
  restart, and corrupt-state recovery, each with explicit pass/fail
  criteria and a ready-to-fill report template at the end.

### Changed
- Bundled NVDA help is now authored in Markdown
  (`addon/doc/en/readme.md`) and converted to HTML at build time by a
  tiny stdlib-only converter (`tools/md_to_html.py`). The built zip
  ships `readme.html`, so NVDA's in-add-on help button opens cleanly
  in the browser with proper `<h1>` / `<h2>` / `<ul>` / `<li>` /
  `<strong>` tags for browse-mode navigation. The source tree stays
  markdown-friendly for screen-reader authoring. `manifest.ini` and
  `buildVars.py` point at `readme.html` (what the zip contains). 21
  new unit tests cover the converter (headings, bullet lists with
  indented continuation lines, inline bold / italic / code / links,
  HTML escaping, document-title extraction).

## [0.1.0] — foundation

Initial release: a working NVDA add-on with zero third-party
dependencies at runtime, in tests, or at build time.

### Added

- **Pure-Python core**, NVDA-free and fully unit-tested:
  - `tree.py` — explicit `child → parent` assignments with cycle
    detection and `explicit_descendants`.
  - `inheritance.py` — effective parent / children that *preserve*
    accessibility structure inside an assigned subtree. Assigning
    `body` keeps `body > container > link > span` nested, not
    flattened into `{container, link, span}` under `body`.
  - `identity.py` — stable hashable IDs across sessions. Walks
    dotted attribute paths (`appModule.appName`, `UIAAutomationId`);
    typed helpers preserve `indexInParent=0` and `windowHandle=0`.
  - `labels.py` — user-assigned display labels for objects with
    poor automation names.
  - `search.py` — facet matcher (`role:button firefox -notepad`).
  - `storage.py` — atomic JSON save; corrupt files are quarantined
    as `<path>.corrupt-<timestamp>` and the add-on recovers cleanly.
  - `facets.py` — pure facet extraction split out of the wx UI so
    it is unit-testable.

- **NVDA integration layer**:
  - `walker.py` — `AccessWalker` over live NVDAObjects with a
    weakref cache, `prime_ancestors`, and a bounded deque-backed
    `search_subtree` BFS so cold-cache lookups across a restart
    still resolve.
  - `navigator.py` — semantic cursor that re-anchors to NVDA's
    current navigator on every gesture so intervening manual moves
    are respected.
  - `plugin.py` — `GlobalPlugin` with seven `@script` gestures.
    Every script guards `api.getNavigatorObject()` returning
    `None`. Every dialog open is try/except-wrapped for graceful
    degradation on NVDA API drift. `_role_text` tries, in order:
    `obj.roleText`, `role.displayString` (modern enum),
    `controlTypes.roleLabels[role]` (legacy), `str(role)`.

- **wx dialogs** (`ui/`):
  - `label.py` — set or clear a custom label.
  - `assign.py` — pick a semantic parent from a `wx.TreeCtrl`.
    Hides the object being assigned *and its descendants* as
    candidate parents so the user cannot create a cycle.
  - `search.py` — live-filtered `wx.ListBox` item chooser.
    Announces when a picked object has been evicted from cache
    instead of closing silently.

- **Gestures** (all rebindable from Input gestures → Semantic Tree):
  - `NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down/Left/Right` — four-way semantic
    navigation (parent / first child / previous / next sibling).
  - `NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+L` — label / relabel.
  - `NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+A` — assign a semantic parent.
  - `NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+F` — search.

- **Build and CI**:
  - `tools/build_addon.py` — stdlib-only script producing
    `semanticTree-0.1.0.nvda-addon`.
  - `tests/run.py` — stdlib-only test runner with filesystem
    auto-discovery (52 tests).
  - GitHub Actions workflow: matrix tests on Python
    3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12 plus the build, on every push and PR.
  - Release workflow: tagging `vX.Y.Z` verifies the manifest
    version matches the tag, runs tests, builds, and publishes a
    GitHub Release with the `.nvda-addon` attached.
  - Dependabot for GitHub Actions updates.

- **Docs**:
  - `README.md` — user-facing overview, features, shortcuts.
  - `docs/local_install.md` — detailed scratchpad and packaged-
    install walkthrough for Windows/NVDA.
  - `docs/developer_guide.md` — architecture and module-by-module
    reference.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — dev setup, day-to-day commands, and a
    seven-step manual smoke-test checklist.
  - `SECURITY.md`, issue / PR templates.
  - `addon/doc/en/readme.html` — bundled in-NVDA help, linked by
    `manifest.ini`.
